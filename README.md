Applications Programming and Assignment 2 both require javaFX to run

JumpGame is inspired by super Mario like game my friend and I created back in high school, where I still haven't finished the game because the last map is too difficult. Learnt to make this game from youtube videos using eclipse. Run the program from Game.java
